#Shopper


A simple google extension that lets you search for similar product on e-commerce websites with a single click.

I have included the code required. To apply this extension, just download the contents and extract them to a folder. Next, open chrome://extensions/ and switch on the developer mode(you can find it on the top right of the screen). Then, click on the 'Load Unpacked' and select the folder which contains the extension, and congrats! The extension is now downloaded.

In this extension, if you are searching for a product (say, for example, a laptop) on either google/amazon/flipkart. What you need to do is just click the extension and choose one of the website like if you clicked flipkart, a new tab will open where you'll get the search results of laptop on flipkart website.
